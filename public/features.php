        <h2>Facial Features</h2>
        Time to get into the facial features. I love doing the facial features. The eyes and mouth are where you get the major detail. Here's step-by-step on how to vector your facial features. We're going to start with the eyes and then move onto the mouth.

        now when doing the eyes you'll have to toggle the visibilty of these layers a lot so you can see what you're working on. This part of the tutorial is listed from top layer to bottom layer so be sure to keep them in order. Let's get started.

        Using black draw the eyelashes.
        This is easy - just trace the outside
        and do little spikes for the lashes.


        Next do the brown circle around the outside of the eye
        normally when i'm doing eyes i use the eyedropper tool
        this way i match the eye colors perfectly.



        Now you want to do the pink portion of the eye.
        I use color #40 or #45 for this



        Here I used a gray color to add little slivers for the detail around the eye.


        Here use a white color to draw the speck
        of light in the eye. I drew it in the shape of a star.


        Now use black to do the pupil.


        Here I used a deep blue/gray for coloring in the eye.


        I used a light brown here to do the iris.


        Now trace the outline of the eye
        Use white for your color here.


        Now use a deep brown to trace the eyebrow.
        you can also use a shade slightly lighter/darker
        to add detail to the eyebrows.
        i left mine simple here.


        now i used a medium tan color to add a makeup look.



        Once you've finished those layers this is what your image should look like so far:



        Does yours look like this? Good. Now we'll move onto the mouth.

        Now for the mouth I used color #s 45-50. These are my favorite colors to use for the lips. Then use 51-53 for the teeth.
        Start with the lighter parts of the lips and move on from there.
        Be sure to leave the edges a little choppy
        until you get to the last layer to help it
        blend in more and make the lips look realistic.

        Here we start on the teeth.
        Use color 51 to draw the lightest parts of the teeth.


        Now use color 52 and go around the outline of the teeth shape.


        Here use color 53 to define the placement of the teeth.


        Then just fill inside of the mouth with black.

        Once you've finished the mouth, it should look something like this:

        Now that we have the face done we're going to move onto the hair. this will be covered in lesson four so move onto that lesson!
