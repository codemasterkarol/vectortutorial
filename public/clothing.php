        <h2>Clothing</h2>
        The clothes are the final step and are always tricky. Unless you have a steady hand and can keep your clothes from looking like they over lap the wrong body parts try to place your layers accordingly. Like the underware would go over the legs/abdomen but below the arms. And the bra would go over the chest and abdomen, but under the arms and then you'd do the straps over everything. Take a look at how I did my clothing. I have a steady hand so I just did mine over everything else. This comes with practice. For the colors I just made up my own. YOu can use any color you want just use light to dark shades of it.


        Now that the bra is done we'll do the undies.


        Now that you've finished the clothing, it should look something like this:


        If yours looks like this, great, you're done!!! If not feel free to go back and work on any mistakes you might have made.

        Now you're ready to move onto the final lesson which will teach you how to save your image in both .ai format and .png format which will help you later if you decide to use it for a layout.
