        <h2>Toolbars</h2>

        I decided to include the main toolbars you'll be using just so you have an idea of what we're using in case you failed to check out the basic vector tutorial. If you already know your toolbars you can skip on to lesson two.

        <h3>Layers</h3>

        As you know, we use layers when creating vectors. Here's what your layers palette looks like.

        The part circled in Yellow is your viewable toggle. When the eye is showing it means the layer is visible. When the eye is not showing it's not visible. You'll be using this feature a lot in this tutorial.

        The part circled in Red is the trash icon. When you screw up a layer or have a layer you don't need, simply highlight the layer (you can see what layer is highlighed as it will be in blue, which you can see on Layer 2 in the image) and click the trash icon to delete that layer.

        The part circled in green is your New Layer icon. When you want to create your next layer for drawing, select the layer below where you want your new layer to appear and then click the new layer icon. Keep in mind that you want to keep your layers in order from light to dark, so like in the image, layer 2 is my lightest color for the face shading and layer 11 is my darkest color in the face shading.

        In layer two, the circle on the right side shows that it's the layer you've selected to work on. If it has a outline around the circle that means that's the layer you're working in - if it's a single circle, it's not the layer you're working on. Easy enough, right?

  That's all for the layers. Now we'll look at the tools palette.

        <h3>Tools</h3>

        You'll only be using two tools in this tutorial, and that's the pencil tool and your color section tool.

        The tool circled in green is your pencil/drawing tool. You'll be using this 99% of the time.

        The part circled in red is your color selection. The solid box is your fill color and the box with the small gray box in the center is your outline box. You want to be sure to have your outline box empty (to do this select the small icon of the square with the red line through it while you have the outline box selected).

        This is your swatches palette. To open your swatch library that you saved in the introductoin click on the little blue arrow that is pointing right on the right side of your swatches tool bar, then look at the bottom of the menu that scrolls down and select "open swatch library" - then you want to open "vectorcolorguide".

        Once this opens the color with the white outline around it is the color you have currently got selected. You'll be toggling between colors a lot in this tutorial.


        That's all for lesson one - move onto lesson two now!
