        Now it's time to get into drawing your actual vector.

        For this vector I used the medium color shades (Colors 15-28) To start select color 15 and select your drawing/pencil tool. Then make sure you have the outline color as blank. Now get started on drawing! First you want to center the face of your image on your screen and zoom in as far as you can while still viewing the whole face. (You can zoom in by pressing CTRL and +, and you can zoom out by using CTRL and - ).

        Start with the lightest shade in the face. Trace around those light areas and then each time you get done with a shade choose your next color and make a new layer BELOW the lighter layer. This is VERY IMPORTANT. Always make sure you have your layers in the right order otherwise they will look screwed up! Now here's a step by step photo-diagram of how I did my face.

        Once you've finished those layers this is what your image should look like so far:

        Does yours look like this? Good. Now we'll move onto the ear.

        The ear is normally pretty complicated. I did a kinda crappy job on this one since it has some deep shadows but anyway just work your way from lightest to darkest again.

        Once you've finished the ear, it should look something like this:

        Now that we have the face and ear shading done we're going to move onto the face details. Those will be covered in lesson three. So move on over there!
