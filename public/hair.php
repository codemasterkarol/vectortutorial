        Time to get into the hair. The hair is the most time-consuming because you have to do a ton of highlights and you have to do each highlight seperately. Let's get started.

        For the hair on this vector I used colors 54-56 and then when i needed darker i just made my own darker color. You can use any set of hair colors you want for this though.

        start with the lightest highlights.
        most of highlighting will be free-form drawing.
        Just look at how I did my hair and try to match it.


        Once you've finished the hair, it should look something like this:


        As you can see I added the darkest color in a
        big circle behind my whole image.
        this covers any gaps I may have missed.
        if you choose to do this right now be sure to
        make it your bottom-most layer.

        Now that we have the face and hair done we're going to move onto the body. The body takes the longest by far since you have so much skin to do. So this will be covered in lessons five through nine. Move on to 5 now!
