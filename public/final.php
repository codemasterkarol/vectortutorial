        Now that you've finished your vector, you'll want to save it. In Illustrator go "File" > "Save Image As..." and save it to your harddrive in .ai format. This way you can go back and edit any layers or whatnot you might want to later on.

        Then you'll want to go "File" > "Export..." > "PNG Format". Then select 300DPI and save the file to your harddrive. This will save it as a transparent image so that you can open your vector later so you can use it in a layout/graphic without the edges looking choppy or anything. This is the best part of illustrator, it makes actually using your vector so much easier!

        When you open your vector at a later date in another program to use it, it will open as a very large image, just resize it to whatever size fits your needs and then all should be well. :)
